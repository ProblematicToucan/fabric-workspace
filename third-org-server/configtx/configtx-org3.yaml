# Org3 MSP definition — same content as configtx.yaml (learning)
# =============================================================================
#
# configtxgen requires the config file to be named configtx.yaml in FABRIC_CFG_PATH;
# that file is configtx.yaml in this directory. This file is a copy with extra
# comments. configtxgen -printOrg Org3MSP reads the config and outputs a JSON
# fragment that gets embedded in the channel config under Application.groups.
# The channel stores the org's MSP (root certs, etc.) and these policies.
#
#   MSPDir: path to org MSP (cacerts, tlscacerts, config.yaml). Relative to
#           the directory containing this file (configtx/).
#
#   Policies (who can do what in the channel for this org):
#     Readers  — can read channel config and ledger (admins, peers, clients).
#     Writers  — can propose config changes and send transactions (admins, clients).
#     Admins   — can update org-level config (only admin certs).
#     Endorsement — who may endorse transactions (peers only in this rule).
